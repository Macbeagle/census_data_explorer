# Census Data Explorer

## Project Overview

The Census Data Explorer is a Shiny application designed to facilitate the browsing, downloading, and management of various census datasets. This application supports multiple census years and types, providing users with a dynamic and interactive tool to select and work with the data relevant to their needs. It includes features to select geography, census type, and the specific area of interest, alongside functionalities to download and subsequently delete data packs directly from the UI.

## Features

- **Dynamic Selection**: Users can select from various census years (2021, 2016, 2011) and data pack types (e.g., GCP, IP, TSP).
- **Geographic Filtering**: Choose from different geographic categorizations based on the selected data pack type.
- **Download Management**: Download data directly through the interface and manage these downloads with options to delete unnecessary files.
- **Reactive Updates**: The UI updates reactively based on user input and interactions.

### Prerequisites

The application will install the necessary packages when run.
It may require admin permission if not in user files to work.
